	<h1>project conception!</h1>
	 
  	<p>
In this project we attempted to explore the importance of ocean pollution and how it effects the world, we found that it is horiably damaging not just to sea life but to the socio economic system in which we reside. 
water pollution is the processes in which plastic and other pollutants are put into a water souce, be it a river, ocean lake or other wises, this practice damages and kills aquatic flora and fauna. 
to illustrate such atrocities, in our project we try to show how bad polluting waterways can be.
